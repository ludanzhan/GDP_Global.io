                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: 500;text-align: justify;"> The official definition of GDP is: "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold (not resold) in a specific time period by countries".
                        We often see GDP serve as an important indicator of a country's economic growth. However, the relationship between total GDP and Population could be controversial, it also leads to another question of whether Total GDP or GDP per Capita is a better indicator of a country's economic development. </p>

                    <p> The choropleth map above displays the total GDP for each country around the world in the year 2021 where the gradient of the color indicates the difference in total GDP. 
                        The darker the color is, the higher the GDP is. When thinking about the total GDP, 
                        it is instinctive to think that country with a larger population will have a higher
                    total GDP. However, in the real situation, the relationship between population growth and 
                    GDP growth is controversial.  </p>

                        <p > The three graphs above show the top 10 countries ranked by: Population, GDP per Capita, and Total GDP. 
                            From the graphs, we can see that the total GDP and Population do not have a direct relationship which 
                            means a country with a large population doesn't imply a high total GDP. i.e, the United States has the highest
                            total GDP but doesn't have the largest population.
                        </p>

                    <div class ="col-md-12">
                        <p>The chart on the left shows the total GDP by continent since 1960, we can see from the graph that
                            the total GDP for each continent displays an increasing trend. Among all continents, North America
                            shows the fastest growing rate. The chart on the right shows the total Population growth since 1960, we can see from the graph that
                            the total population from the past 60 years for each continent is steadily increasing. Among all continents, East Asia shows
                            the most population. </p>
                        <p style="font-weight:bold;">From both graphs, we can see that although East Asia has the most population, its total GDP
                            doesn't appear to be the highest. Vice versa, North America has a relatively small population but has the highest total GDP. 
                            Therefore, when using GDP as an index of ecnomic growth, it's worth mentioning the GDP per Capita.
                        </p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">The overall GDP growth rate by continent generally follows the World GDP growth trend
                    </p>

                <div class="col-md-12" >
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;"> In conclusion, when using GDP as a analysis indicator, it is worth to consider all three factors: Total GDP ,GDP per Capita, and Population.
                        Since there isn't any direct relationship in between those three factors.
