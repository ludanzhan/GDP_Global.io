# GDP Analysis

## Project Objective
The official definition of GDP is: "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold (not resold) in a specific time period by countries". We often see GDP serve as an important indicator of a country's economic growth. However, the relationship between total GDP and Population could be controversial, it also leads to another question of whether Total GDP or GDP per Capita is a better indicator of a country's economic development.

This project is to provide data visualization to discuss the relationship between GDP and Population. 

## Library Used & Programming Language
- **JavaScript**: Mainly used for frontend design
- **Boostrap**: External styling sheet
- **D3**: Data Visulization Tools

## Visualization Charts and Reasoning
- **Bar Chart**: A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. In this case, I choose bar charts to display the number difference between each country's Total GDP, GDP per Capita, and Population. 
- **Line Chart**: A line chart is a type of chart used to show information that changes over time. The dataset used in this project contains information on the Total GDP and Population of each country from 1960 to 2021. The best way to display the changing in GDP and Population over time is with a line chart. 
- **Choropleth Map**:A choropleth map is a type of map that uses a color gradient to correspond with an aggregate summary of numeric data. Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a variable varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region. In this project, I use a choropleth map to directly display the geographical distribution of total GDP of different ranges.
- **Density Plot**: A density plot shows the changes of a variable over time with a filled color. In this study, I first plot the total GDP changing rate since 1960 of each continent and covers the chart with a density chart of the world GDP change rate since 1960. The purpose of this is to see if one of the continents has a different changing pattern, and if there exists such a continent, it would be worth discovering the reason.
